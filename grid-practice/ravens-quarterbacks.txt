The Ravens quarterback injury carousel

Lamar Jackson is the Ravens' starting quarterback. He suffered a knee injury in the first quarter of his team's 10-9 win over the Denver Broncos on Sunday, Dec. 4. He is expected to return in one-to-three weeks. Jackson is the in the final year of his rookie contract, and the former first-round NFL draft pick is believed to be holding out for a fully guaranteed contract worth more than $250 million.

Tyler Huntley is the Ravens' primary backup quarterback. He entered the game against the Broncos on Dec. 4 and led the offense on a 91-yard, game-winning drive. Huntley, however, was forced from the game during the Ravens' eventual victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, Dec. 10. He is in the NFL's concussion protocol, and it's unclear when he'll be cleared to play again.

Anthony Brown had been the Ravens' practice squad quarterback — meaning he practiced with the team, but was not eligible to play in a game — before Jackson's injury forced Brown to the active roster. He entered the game against the Steelers in the third quarter, after Huntley entered the concussion protocol, and may be asked to start again Saturday vs. the Cleveland Browns.
