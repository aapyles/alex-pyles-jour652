      <p>This is a simple web page designed to address two coding questions. I recreated some of your code but modified the styles.</p>

      <p>Above is an example of how to align a label and headline. The primary problem with your exisiting code is that the headline and label (your #where ID) had different padding. In the above example, the padding is equal.</p>

      <p>The example also uses line-height to achieve the look that I wanted.</p>

      <p>Below is an example of how to set link states when classes are also applied. Check the CSS for this page to see how I targeted links that are defined by a specific class.</p>

      <p>My code turns the links red on hover.</a>

    <ul>

      <!-- This section shows HTML for changing link state. I created lists for demonstration purposes only. -->

      <li><a class="nav" href="https://baltimoreravens.com">Baltimore Ravens</a></li>
      <li><a class="nav"  href="https://nfl.com">NFL</a></li>
      <li><a class="nav" href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/">Pro-Football Reference</a></li>

      <!-- End link state HTML -->
